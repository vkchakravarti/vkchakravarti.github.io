title: Why should India’s Financial Year begin on All Fool’s Day?
---

Even as the origin of celebrating All Fool’s Day on April 1 is lost in antiquity, what continues to puzzle me is the State’s continuing with the practice of promising budgetary proposals for the new Financial Year on All Fool’s Day.

Agreed, this annual ritual might have begun as playing pranks upon unsuspecting peers, but it shouldn’t have taken the form of everybody fooling around everybody else, throughout the year and beyond. 
 
The worst: fooling has over the years emerged as an art. As it needs no formal training, the wise have devised ways to ensure fools remain perpetually fools. Just as business thrives on clients and slumlords thrive on slum-dogs, the wise continue to thrive on fools. Alas, it’s no more restricted to individuals. Nations are also at war to fool one another. After all, it is a fair game. It doesn’t require any referee or regulator.

The wise tend to lay trap, wait with bait, force others to commit folly, falter on steps, default on payment, and then they attack. They argue that since fools are often lazy and lethargic like sloth bears they deserve to slog, though it’s not always true. The laziest bums in several organisations are envied as the wisest guys.

As if to challenge Abraham Lincoln’s classic statement on fools, everybody now tries to fool all the people, all the time – maybe with varying degrees of success. The fooling business has become as commonplace as every vehicle trying to overtake every other vehicle at any given time – be it on the expressways or in the congested streets. There is a trap in every step.
 
**Fool’s Paradise**

As to what others say on fools make some sense. The modern concept of ‘World Happiness Index’ seems to have developed from Shakespeare’s concept of ‘fool’s paradise’ in ‘Romeo and Juliet’, which defined it as the state of happiness based on false hope.  Mark Twain has described the practice as ‘tom-foolery’ in his satire ‘The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn’. Playwrights Henrik Ibsen and George Bernard Shaw had said it differently that if democracy is the rule by majority, the majority is of fools.

The wise classify fools for their own convenience into ‘lesser fools’, ‘greater fools’, ‘greatest fools’, ‘outright fools’ and ‘genuine fools’. The ‘honest fools’ still think that honesty is the best policy. Idiots and blockheads are some other variations. A ‘simple man’ is a noble soul, but a ‘simpleton’ is a fool. Urbanites also look down upon all rustic fellows as fools. The rightists and leftists consider activists fighting corruption or injustice as fool. The debate is on.
 
When the wise don’t find any circumstantial evidence to call a person fool, they search for similarities from the Animal Kingdom. In northern India, *‘bakra’* or a sacrificial lamb is considered an ‘ultimate fool’. In the Hindi belt, it is the owl, although a large number of people consider owl as a vehicle of Goddess of Wealth. Some consider elephants and horses as pampered fools, as well as all beasts of burden, even slaves and bonded labour. 
What does the law say on foolery? The custodians of law say: “Law has long arm.” The lawbreakers say: “The law is an ass.” This led to a heated debate on who’s the greater fool – a donkey or an ass? Since the wild ass is a free animal, domesticated donkey wins the race as the symbol or icon of fool, for its obstinacy and subjugation.
 
The problem with the fools is that they don’t realise that they are being taken for a ride. The bigger problem is with the simple souls who are made to look like simpletons, because of their incapacity to come out of their predicament and circumstances in which they are born or thrown into.
 
Ironically, the State doesn’t seem to be keen to resolve the riddle of starting the Financial Year on All Fool’s Day. Even banks, which earlier used to observe Half Yearly Banking Holidays on June 30 and December 31, have fallen in line with the universal foolery to observe ‘Bank’s Annual Closing Day’ on March 31 to synchronize the new Banking Year with All Fool’s Day.  With continued abundance of fools in most walks of life, it’s around time the State comes out of this inconvenient ignominy, fast!
